== Health is the ultimate wealth
If you are healthy of mind and body you can always do something to make your life better.

Without your health you have nothing, make it a top priority in life.

Taking care of your body and mind daily is not a waste of time.

== Exercise your body daily
Make sure you move your body on a daily basis. Morning exercise will make you feel better about the rest of the day, it will give you momentum to achieve more. For instance, just running can also be a great way to process what's happening in your life and to get creative towards your immediate or long term goals.

Daily exercise can be part of a ritual for high productivity. Whenever I don't exercise I'm usually less productive.

== Wash your hands with soap
This basic and obvious advice is actually not followed by lots of people, you can see it in public restrooms when people don't do it, and you can see it in friends that constantly get sick and have a bunch of unintended consequences to deal with because of not having this simple habit. Unwashed hands inevitably bring illness, downtime in your productivity, and unexpected costs.

== Do not eat more than you need
One meal a day is actually more than enough, two meals are easy, three meals are unnecessary.

Our bodies are the product of tens of thousands of years of evolution and they're not meant to have as many calories as today's food abundance is easily able to provide us, this, along with lack of mobility is the reason why almost everybody around us is obese.

Intermittent fasting has an array of health benefits in hormonal control,  blood sugar levels, improved cell reproduction/destruction, rejuvenation and life expectancy, clearer thinking, also, it helps you remain humble.

== Do not eat processed foods
Eat foods as close to their natural state as possible. Meats, vegetables and some grains.

== Avoid soft drinks and juices, don't drink your calories
Stick to water, lemon juice water (no sugar), tea and coffee.


== Avoid milk, soy milk
Milk is essentially liquid sugar and cow hormones you don't need. Lactose = sugar from milk. No benefits.

Soy milk has some natural ingredients that slow the digestion of protein and carbs and can decrease the body's ability to absorb other necessary nutrients. There's also controversy in the amount of estrogens soy milk carries, just avoid it. Less is more.

If you must, stick to "Oat milk".

== Reduce or eliminate fruit intake
Fructose can only be metabolized by your liver whereas other sugars like glucose can be used as energy by every other cell in the body. Too many fruits can saturate your liver, thus increasing the chance of having high cholesterol or some other conditions like diabetes.

== Drink a lot of water
Have with you a 1 or 2 liter water container all day. To make it easier I add lemon juice and ice. Drinking water makes intermittent fasting much easier. You know you're doing it right if your urine is clear.

== Run or do cardio for at least 45mins to 1 hour a day
If you can however run 6 miles (10km) this is the sweet spot for cardio and endorphins.

== Cardio in the mornings, weights/strength/technical training in the evenings
Morning is an awesome time to get cardio in, especially cardio on an empty stomach. By doing some low moderate intensity cardio on an empty stomach, you are burning primarily fat. Cardio helps keep your metabolism in check, gives you a stronger heart (of course) and better breathing and endurance for whatever other physical activities.

Then for your second workout session of the day, you no longer need to worry about time or energy spent on cardio. After a judicious warm up to avoid injuries you will be solely focused on what you're about to train, in my case it's climbing, and then if I have time left I will do weights.

== Do strength training at least 4x/week
Lifting, Climbing, Martial Arts, Calisthenics

== Resting is training
If you're going hard, leave a day or two of training, recovery is key to getting stronger. Listen to your body.

Sometimes it's also necessary to work out moderately and not "kill" yourself on every session so that you can train more regularly. This will depend on the phase of your training cycle.

== Be in nature as much as possible
Be around nature or at least outdoors exposed to the sun at least one hour a day. If the weather does not allow for this, consider moving to another city.

We are humans and there are multiple emotional, cognitive (focus, awareness) and health benefits to being outdoor and in nature.

== Stay away from Alcohol, Meth, Opiates, Cocaine, Heroin and Nicotine
Alcohol which is a widely accepted and encouraged drug by friends is very destructive and it has also very bad effects when it comes to ageing. It's total crap, stay away from it. If you must drink, do so very moderately, do not make it a habit.

Beer? no more than two. Wine? no more than two glasses. Whiskey or stronger spirits, add ice and sip it very slowly. Getting wasted is stupid, you're literally poisoning your body and all the bad reactions like puking, headaches are your body trying to rid of the alcohol.

I have lost multiple loved ones to alcohol alone.

The other drugs mentioned are self destructive and highly addictive, do not even try, you will regret them.

== NMN, NAD+, Resveratrol

NMN stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide, a molecule naturally occurring in all life forms. At the molecular level, it is a ribo-nucleotide, which is a basic structural unit of the nucleic acid RNA.

NMN is the direct precursor of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and is considered a key component to increase NAD+ levels in cells.

NAD+ plays an especially active role in metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, the TCA Cycle (AKA Krebs Cycle or Citric Acid cycle), and the electron transport chain, which occurs in our mitochondria and is how we obtain cellular energy.

NAD+ Helps Control DNA Damage. According to the current aging theory in 2022, the accumulation of DNA damage is the main cause of aging.

NAD+ is the fuel that helps sirtuins sustain genome integrity and promote DNA repair.

Results from animal studies showed that raising NAD+ level in the body activates sirtuins and increases the lifespans of yeast, worms and mice. Although animal studies showed promising results in anti-aging properties, scientists are still studying how these results can translate to humans.

NAD+ is one of the keys to maintaining healthy mitochondrial functions and steady energy output. Aging and high-fat diet reduces the level of NAD+ in the body.

Boosting NAD+ levels protects the heart and improves cardiac functions. High blood pressure can cause an enlarged heart and blocked arteries that lead to strokes.

NMN is produced from B vitamins in the body. The enzyme responsible for making NMN in the body is called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)

NMN is Quickly Converted to NAD+.

Resveratrol could be found in many foods, such as grapes, red wine, peanuts, and blueberries. Many studies reported that resveratrol possessed various bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protection, anticancer, antidiabetes mellitus, antiobesity, neuroprotection, and antiaging effects. The antiaging mechanisms of resveratrol were mainly ameliorating oxidative stress, relieving inflammatory reaction, improving mitochondrial function, and regulating apoptosis. Resveratrol could be an effective and safe compound for the prevention and treatment of aging and age-related diseases.

NMN and Resveratrol often come together in supplements I consume daily (1 gram daily)


== Whey Protein and Glutathione

Whey is a protein complex derived from milk with a diverse range of health benefits. It is a rich source of the essential amino acids in higher concentrations compared with vegetable sources such as soy.

It contains a high concentration of branched-chain amino acids, which are important for tissue growth and repair.

Whey protein is rich in the sulfur-containing amino acids, which enhance the body‚Äôs antioxidant protection through intracellular conversion to glutathione.

Glutathione is arguably the most important water-soluble antioxidant found in the body, participating in crucial detoxification reactions in the liver. Glutathione is known to be essential to immunity, body antioxidative capacity, and general well-being, and decreased levels of glutathione are associated with a long list of ailments such as neurodegenerative disease, cirrhosis, and the aging process itself.

== Creatine

Creatine supplementation works by increasing intramuscular and intracerebral stores of creatine and phosphocreatine, which helps prevent ATP depletion, stimulate protein synthesis, and reduce protein breakdown. The way I see it, it helps you recycle ATP (your cell's energy currency) which helps you train longer and harder.

There seems to also be a synergy between Whey Protein and Creatine for enhancing resistance training.

As we age, we can suffer from a condition known as "sarcopenia", which means muscular atrophy and loss of strength, creatine should help us with preserving our muscle mass.

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells, and it's well known for its role in muscle building and improving athletic performance. However, its benefits go beyond just strength training and muscle mass.

 - Muscle Building and Strength: Creatine supplementation helps your muscles produce more energy during high-intensity exercise by increasing phosphocreatine stores. These stores allow for faster regeneration of ATP (your body's energy currency), which helps you lift heavier, run faster, or climb harder for longer periods. Studies show that consistent creatine intake can significantly boost strength, endurance, and lean muscle mass when combined with resistance training.

 - Preventing Muscle Loss with Age: As we age, maintaining muscle mass becomes crucial in preventing sarcopenia, or muscle deterioration. Creatine supplementation can help slow this process and keep muscles stronger for longer, ensuring better mobility and health into older age. It's a simple addition that can support your longevity and fitness goals.

 - Brain Health and Cognitive Function: While creatine is widely known for its physical benefits, recent studies suggest it may have positive effects on brain health as well. The brain, like muscles, also uses ATP for energy. By increasing creatine stores, you may improve cognitive performance, particularly in tasks requiring memory and quick thinking. It can also help protect the brain against mental fatigue and stress during intense cognitive activities, just like it does for muscles during exercise.

**How to Use Creatine**: It's generally recommended to take 3-5 grams of creatine daily, preferably with a carbohydrate source to improve absorption. For best results, pair it with your workouts, but also keep up your hydration. Drinking plenty of water ensures proper utilization of creatine and helps prevent cramping during intense exercise.

== Glutamine

Glutamine is required for countless functions in the human body, including maintaining muscle tissue and supporting immune system function.

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and is highly concentrated in the skeletal muscles that make movement possible.

Compelling evidence suggests that glutamine may be especially important for adults seeking to preserve lean tissue mass.

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and is highly concentrated in the skeletal muscles that make movement possible. Maintaining healthy skeletal muscle is essential to overall good health and mobility.

Glutamine may offer benefits for muscle health by increasing growth hormone levels. Since youthful levels of growth hormone are associated with tissue building and repair, nutritional scientists have long sought methods of naturally enhancing growth hormone levels.

Evidence suggests that glutamine may help replenish muscle glycogen stores after intense exercise.

Intense exercise is known to reduce glutamine stores, making less glutamine available for supporting healthy immune system function and leaving individuals susceptible to infections.

I always take Glutamine after my intense workouts.

== Glucosamine and Chondroitin
Glucosamine and chondroitin are two naturally occurring compounds within your cartilage. One of many important purposes of cartilage is to protect and cushion the ends of your bones.

In my experience (not sure if it's placebo), pain in my wrists, elbows and knees after I turned 30 from extended workouts has gone away after taking 2 pills for a few days in a row. Many experts still do not agree on its effectiveness, so just give them a skeptical try and see if they help you.

== Collagen: Building Blocks for Your Skin, Joints, and Muscles

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and plays a vital role in maintaining the **integrity of your skin, joints, and muscles**. As we age, collagen production naturally declines, leading to **wrinkles**, **joint pain**, and **loss of muscle mass**. However, supplementing with collagen can help slow this process and provide several key benefits:

- **Skin Health and Elasticity**: Collagen is essential for maintaining the **elasticity and hydration** of your skin. Regular supplementation can help reduce the appearance of **fine lines and wrinkles**, promoting a more youthful appearance. It's a natural way to keep your skin looking healthy and vibrant for longer.

- **Joint and Bone Support**: Collagen supports the structure of **cartilage**, which cushions your joints. Supplementing with collagen can reduce **joint pain** and improve **mobility**, especially in people suffering from osteoarthritis or those engaged in regular physical activity. It also helps maintain **bone density**, making it an essential nutrient for long-term bone health.

- **Muscle Mass and Recovery**: Collagen plays a role in maintaining **lean muscle mass**. It provides key amino acids like **glycine** and **proline**, which are necessary for muscle repair and recovery. Supplementing with collagen, especially when combined with resistance training, can support muscle strength and help prevent age-related muscle loss.

**How to Take Collagen**: You can find collagen in **powder** or **capsule** form, making it easy to integrate into your daily routine. It mixes well with liquids like coffee, tea, or smoothies. Consistent supplementation, combined with a balanced diet and exercise, will help you maximize its benefits.

Collagen is more than just a beauty supplement‚Äîit's a powerful protein that supports your overall **joint**, **muscle**, and **skin health**, keeping you feeling and looking great as you age.


== Moisturize your skin after showers/baths

Take care of your skin after you shower or take a bath, specially if you live in a dry climate. It will remain healthy, shiny and young looking for longer. This I learned from my grandma Ata who had such beautiful skin and looked youthful for very long.
